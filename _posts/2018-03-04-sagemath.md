How I use SageMath, and my installation notes (on macOS).

## Installation notes

I compiled Sage from binary. Using the command `sage -n jupyter` was fine for
opening the Jupyter notebook interface.

Later, I realized I wanted `nbextensions` (namely, the
[jupyter-vim-binding](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding)) for
all my Jupyter notebooks. (See [“Unofficial Jupyter Notebook Extensions — jupyter_contrib_nbextensions 0.4.0 documentation”](http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Retrieved March 4, 2018.)

I discovered that Sage uses its own version of the Jupyter notebook, whence I
needed to [install sagemath as a kernel in Jupyter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39296020/how-to-install-sagemath-kernel-in-jupyter). I followed [Samuel Lelièvre](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3827575/samuel-leli%c3%a8vre)'s edited process
```
sudo jupyter kernelspec install ./SageMath/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath
```
> Where SageMath is your root sagemath directory.

In my case `/Applications/SageMath/`. Further, they advised

> ...edit the `kernel.json` file to make the SageMath Jupyter kernel aware of SageMath's location, by adding `"env":{"SAGE_ROOT":"/path/to/sage"}` at the end of the dictionary in `kernel.json`. 
>
> You will find the location of `kernel.json` by executing `jupyter kernelspec list`.

In my case, I find this file in `/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath`.
`kernel.json` requires admin permissions to write. My `kernel.json` now reads

```
{
 "display_name": "SageMath 8.0", 
 "argv": [
  "/Applications/SageMath/local/bin/sage", 
  "--python", 
  "-m", 
  "sage.repl.ipython_kernel", 
  "-f", 
  "{connection_file}"], 
 "env":{"SAGE_ROOT":"/Applications/SageMath/"}
}
```

whence SageMath is loaded as a kernel in the (standard) Jupyter Notebook.
