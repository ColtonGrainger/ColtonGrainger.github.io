I sliced up a messy paper I'd written in 2015 for Dr. Eric Spencer's English Renaissance Literature. I wrote the paper off campus, in downtown Boise, which was challenging due to the cold, and BSU's limited library hours. Nevertheless, I am inspired by Bacon's treatment of scholastic superstition. I felt it necessary to boil down the paper to verse.

In 1572, Tycho Brahe observed 
	a sudden and continuous rain of light 
		eminating from the celestial realm of Cassiopeia. 

After a number of weeks, he noted that 
	this new source of light failed to shift 
		in position relative to the fixed heavenly sphere.

The source lacked parallax 
	and must then have been located upon the surface 
		of the celestial realm. 

He published De Nova Stella in 1573, 
	claiming a new star had come into existence 
		above the sublunary realm 
			with the expressed conviction that 
				the world was hastening to its end.

Tycho's new star is known today 
to have been the electromagnetic trace of SN 1572.

We have the technical vocabulary 
to describe that which he observed: 

	a star under enormous pressure 
	whereby the free electrons of the stellar interior
	were forceably melded with protons to create 
	a single giant atomic nucleus
	imploded violently with exterior plasma collapsing 
	only to rebound gallantly outwards

50 years later, proper time, 
with the publication of the Novum Organum,
Francis Bacon proclaimed 
	the newness of a method availible to human thought, 
	by which the species might establish progresive stages of certainty.

Bacon differentiates his inductive method from Socratic midwifery 
	in that Bacon retains the senses, 
	helped and guided 
		by a certain process of correction.

	However, Bacon's method is new 
	because he rejects 
	the mental operation 
	that follows an act of sense.

Is Bacon's a method we to ought hunt and apprehend? 

From Socrates:

	"my art of midwifery is in most respects like theirs; 
	but differs, in that I attend men and not women; 
	and look after their souls when they are in labour, 
	and not after their bodies: 

	"and the triumph of my art is 
	in thoroughly examining 
	whether the thought which the mind of the young man 
	brings forth is a false idol or a noble and true birth.

	"Take a look round, then, 
	and see that none of the uninitiated are listening.

	"Now by the uninitiated I mean: 
	the people who believe in nothing 
	but what they can grasp in their hands, 
	and who will not allow 
	that action or generation 
	or anything invisible 
	can have real existence.

	"Yes, indeed, Socrates, 
	they are very hard and impenetrable mortals. 

	"Yes, my boy, outer barbarians.
	Far more ingenious 
	are the brethren whose mysteries 
	I am about to reveal to you.

Bacon identifies that 
	in supersition arguments are fitted to practice 
		in a reversed order.

Where the doctrine of schoolmen bare great sway
the schoolmen were like the astronomers,
	which did feign 
		eccentrics and epicycles 
		and such engines of orbs 
		to save the phenomena, 
	though they knew there were no such things.

Superstition is
	when things are either abhord or obserued
	with a zealous or fearefull
	but erroneous relation to God.

1. A tendancy to fly up 
	too quickly to generalizations

2. A tendency to identify its own sense of order 
	with the cosmic order

3. A tendency to ignore or suppress 
	whatever does not accord

4. A tendecy to assent 
	to forms---
		logical, 
		rhythmical, 
		syntactical
