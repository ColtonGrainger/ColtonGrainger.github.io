Finished speaking with Nikki Sanderson. Here's the bullet list.

- What's in a PhD?
	- for Jim Meiss, 2 papers
	- for Liz Bradley, the PhD is an organic experience
	- When do I know that I have done enough work?
		- members of the research community need to communicate
		- is data science collaborative? not really
	- dept & cultural differences
	- Nikki has a preprint for a cross-disciplinary intro to TDA
		- time series in dynamical systems

- regarding preliminaries
	- Nikki bulked up on Riemannian Geometry (cool)
	- differential geometry, algebra, topology
- comprehensive exams
	- reading applied topology

- applications
	- effecient algorithms
	- TDA has different constraints comparatively
		- not manifold learning
	- [image analysis](https://youtu.be/GKlcY1bIYDk) Paul Hand's introduction
	- materials, mining, etc
	- ice-cap melting

People:
- [Jim Meiss](http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/jdm/)
- Lizz Bradley
- [Anges Beadury](https://sites.google.com/view/agnesbeaudry)

What's the goal? We need to perform persistent homology. We have a data set to represent as a simplicial complex. How to build? What're the parameters? What's the good radius? As we vary the radius (and some other parameters) how does the homology change?

Software: 
- JavaPlex
	- great tutorial, works with MatLab
- Persius 
	- acts as a package for Python to call?
	- [discrete morse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Morse_theory)
	- simplifies complex while preserving homology (fast!)
- Dionysus
- PHAT
	- works well with R?

Then some more resources:
- [TDA for an environmental application](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-30379-6_22)
- [Jim's research in contaminant clean-up](http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/jdm/research.html#Groundwater)
- [Vidit Nanda's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqajfI4-WnM)
- [Kathryn Hess Bellwald](https://hessbellwald-lab.epfl.ch/HessBellwald)
	- [publications](https://hessbellwald-lab.epfl.ch/publications)
	- some application to neuro-science, which loops around with potential treatments of MS
	- blue brain project
