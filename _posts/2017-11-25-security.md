As I move more information online, what information do I need to encrypt? to back-up?

Currently, my personal files are backed up to an unencrypted hard drive and, if public, hosted redundantly on github.

## Security Goals

- hosting my website on linode and adding a public key certificate
- understanding and implementing PGP for emails
- symmetric encryption for personal documents

## Personal Documents 

Having worked at a refugee resettlement agency, I believe the following documents should be redundantly (and securely) stored online. Maybe also on optical disk?

- national origin documents
- medical records
- financial history

## Backups 

- [“Backing Up Your Data”](https://linode.com/docs/security/backups/backing-up-your-data/). Linode Guides & Tutorials. Retrieved April 21, 2018.
- [“duplicity”](http://duplicity.nongnu.org/)
- [“Uses This / John MacFarlane”](https://usesthis.com/interviews/john.macfarlane/).

## Privacy

I need to [save my passwords](http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/doc/msmtp.html#Authentication) in a keyring. I'd also like to create a [PGP key](ttps://pgp.mit.edu) to share. See [riseup.net](https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/certificates).

To make strong passwords, might learn a bit about Shannon Entropy. see [pthree](https://pthree.org/)

From [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/plogp.html)

   I was reading an obituary of Shannon, 
   asking myself: 
   why did it take till 1948?
   That the semantics of a message 
   are irrelevant to how to transmit it, 
   that the distribution from which the message was 
   chosen is all that matters, 
   is obvious.
