I review [Math 310: Ordinary Differential Equations](https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171655/http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu:80/~barannyk/Teaching/Math310.html) as taught by Lyudmyla Barranyk. Again, I took this as a correspondence course Fall 2017 through the University of Idaho.

I wrote up my [coursework](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/master/odes/) in jupyter notebooks. I relied extensively on plotting and numerical simulation for error checking.

We used *Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems: Computing and Modeling* Edwards, Penney and Calvis. Unlike Rosoff's offering of the same class, we focused on Laplace transforms rather than systems of linear differential equations.

Having already been exposed to the subject, I was not perturbed total lack of camaraderie in a correspondence course.
