I review 
[Math 310: Ordinary Differential Equations](https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171655/http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu:80/~barannyk/Teaching/Math310.html)
as taught by Lyudmyla Barranyk. Again, I took this as a correspondence course
Fall 2017 through the University of Idaho.

I wrote up my
[coursework](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/pro18eo/tree/master/old/odes/)
in jupyter notebooks. I relied extensively on plotting and numerical simulation
for error checking.

We used *Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems: Computing and
Modeling* Edwards, Penney and Calvis. Unlike Rosoff's offering of the same
class, we focused on Laplace transforms rather than systems of linear
differential equations.
