Software I use and I want to try out. I've sourced to the folks through whom I learned of the software. 

## in use

- vim for text editing[^vim]
- Gmail as my single email inbox[^mutt] 
- Hangouts for video chats[^hangouts] 
- emacs org-mode to catalog tasks and TODO lists[^emacs] 
- scheduleonce for meetings[^scheduleonce]

- `git` for version control
- BitTorrent for peer-to-peer file sharing

- SAGE for python-based mathematics[^sage] 
- Jupyter notebooks for exposition[^jupyter]  
  - I have a tendency to jump straight into REPL computations before sketching
    proofs on paper (just something to be cautious of).
  - I bricked my macOS when I tried to install
    [jupyter-vim-binding](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding) 
    but I think that's the direction I want to go.
 
- Firefox for browsing[^firefox] 
  - occasionally TOR or Chrome
- Anki for memorization[^anki] 
- OED 2nd Edition for etymology[^oed]

- Google Maps for transit routes and location data[^maps] 

## to try

- greasemonkey to extend Firefox[^greasemonkey]
- mutt to "tame email" 
- Pollen for lisp based typography[^pollen] 
- PreTeXt to write XML based mathematical manuscripts[^mathbook] 
- nbgrader for recitation[^nbgrader] 
- JupyterHub as a standardized computing platform for multiple users[^jupyterhub]  
- uiki mix screenshots and photos inline with plaintext[^uiki]
