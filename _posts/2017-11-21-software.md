Software I use and I want to try out. I've referenced folks I think model "high-level use" of the various programs. My [dotfiles](https://github.com/coltongrainger/dotfiles) are on GitHub.

## in use

- vim for text editing[^vim]
- Gmail as my single email inbox[^mutt] 
- Hangouts for video chats[^hangouts] 
- emacs org-mode to catalog tasks and TODO lists[^emacs] 
- OED 2nd Edition[^oed]
- Google Maps[^maps] 
- scheduleonce for meetings[^scheduleonce]
- jekyll for static-site generation[^jekyll][^blog] 
- `git` for version control
- BitTorrent for peer-to-peer file sharing
- SAGE for python-based mathematics[^sage] 
- Jupyter notebooks for exposition[^jupyter]  
    - I have a tendency to jump straight into REPL computations before
      sketching proofs on paper (just something to be cautious of).
    - key-bindings [jupyter-vim-binding](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding).
- Firefox for browsing[^firefox] 
    - greasemonkey to extend Firefox[^greasemonkey]
    - occasionally TOR or Chrome
- newsbeauter[^newsboat]
- debian squeeze
- tmux
- mutt to "tame email" 
- gimp

## to try

- Pollen for lisp based typography[^pollen] 
- PreTeXt to write XML based mathematical manuscripts[^mathbook] 
- nbgrader for recitation[^nbgrader] 
- JupyterHub as a "standardized computing platform for multiple users"[^jupyterhub]  
- uiki for note taking[^uiki]
- ubuntu on a linode server (?)

## old 

- audacity
- Virtual DJ (I'm sworn off of it).
- Anki for memorization[^anki] 
- macOS (old personal laptop)
