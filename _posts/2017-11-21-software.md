Software I use and I want to try out. I've sourced to the folks through whom I learned of the software. 

## in use

- vim for text editing[^vim]
- Gmail as my single email inbox[^mutt] 
- Hangouts for video chats[^hangouts] 
- emacs org-mode to catalog tasks and TODO lists[^emacs] 
- scheduleonce for meetings[^scheduleonce]

- jekyll for static-site generation[^jekyll][^blog] 
- `git` for version control
- BitTorrent for peer-to-peer file sharing

- SAGE for python-based mathematics[^sage] 
- Jupyter notebooks for exposition[^jupyter]  
  - I have a tendency to jump straight into REPL computations before sketching
    proofs on paper (just something to be cautious of).
  - I bricked my macOS when I tried to install
    [jupyter-vim-binding](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding) 
    but I think that's the direction I want to go.
 
- Firefox for browsing[^firefox] 
  - occasionally TOR or Chrome
- Anki for memorization[^anki] 
- OED 2nd Edition for etymology[^oed]

- Google Maps for transit routes and location data[^maps] 

## to try

- greasemonkey to extend Firefox[^greasemonkey]
- mutt to "tame email" 
- Pollen for lisp based typography[^pollen] 
- PreTeXt to write XML based mathematical manuscripts[^mathbook] 
- nbgrader for recitation[^nbgrader] 
- JupyterHub as a standardized computing platform for multiple users[^jupyterhub]  
- uiki mix screenshots and photos inline with plaintext[^uiki]

John Regehr's [“The Basic Toolbox – Embedded in Academia”](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1578). 
A version control system: Git is the obvious choice; the main thing you should
have is a basic Github-centric workflow including pull requests, remotes,
dealing with merge conflicts, etc.

A text editor

A graphing program
A presentation tool Powerpoint, Keynote, Google Slides, something LaTeX based,
etc.

An interactive debugger for native executables: LLDB, GDB, something IDE-based.

A generic build system: Make, CMake, etc.

A scripting language: This is for low-grade automation, quick and dirty data
analysis tasks, etc. Python and JavaScript would seem like natural choices.
Around 20 years ago I was an intern at a networking company and my supervisor
popped out of a meeting with some data concerning switch errors, and asked me
to do some analysis to locate the underlying pattern. I wasn’t sure how; he
handed me a Perl book and I was able to get the job done before the meeting
ended.

A shell language: This is probably bash or PowerShell, but there are plenty of
other choices. There’s some overlap with scripting languages but I think there
are two distinct niches here: a shell language is for scripting a smallish
number of commands, doing a bit of error checking, and perhaps looping or
interacting with the user slightly This sort of job is a bit too cumbersome in
Python, Perl, or JavaScript.

A systems language: This is for creating servers, daemons, and other code that
wants to go fast, use little memory, have few dependencies, and interact
tightly with the OS. C or C++ would be the obvious choices, but Rust and Go may
be fine too.

A workhorse language: This is your default programming language for most tasks,
it should have a huge collection of high-quality libraries, be pretty fast, run
on all common platforms, have a great tool ecosystem, etc. Racket, Java, Scala,
OCaml, C#, Swift, or Haskell would be great — even C++ would work.

A pocket calculator: This is your go-to REPL for basic arithmetic and
conversions between number representations, it should be near-instantaneous to
get answers. For reasons I no longer remember, I use gdb for this — typically
multiple times in any work day. Old standbys like bc and dc also seem like bad
choices. I’m curious what other people do here.

It's high time to get my dotfiles on GitHub.
