## Privacy

I need to [save my passwords](http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/doc/msmtp.html#Authentication) in the GNOME keyring. I'd also like to create a [PGP key](ttps://pgp.mit.edu) to share.

Probably also need to understand Shannon Entropy. 
- [pthree](https://pthree.org/)
- Scott Aaronson also has poetry on the subject.

## Headaches

I think I'm mentally overstimulated with managing *3* computing devices. Pros: they're all unix-like environments, also I get experience with version control from many machines; cons: I hate configuring settings over and over, I'm also finding loopholes in my productive process, (right now bumping an [open bug report to disable guest browsing on chromium](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chrome-admins/RHF22jqINBw/J9uqnYpfCQAJ) so that I can't take mental vacations and pretend I'm somebody else 
online).

At the same time, by insisting on a browser with *one* user, plus extensions, and *no* guests, I feel antiquated and modest: rep'n "the beggar's virtue"..

I have some anxiety of losing my identity (or just wiping slate and coming back as pure ego). I think of Volpone's reveal and attempted seduction of Celia (with her protesting on moral grounds his gregarious carnal appetite). How would I react?

<pre>
VOLP: 'Tis the beggar's virtue,
If thou hast wisdom, hear me, Celia.
Thy baths shall be the juice of July-flowers,
Spirit of roses, and of violets,
The milk of unicorns, and panthers' breath
Gather'd in bags, and mixt with Cretan wines.
Our drink shall be prepared gold and amber;
Which we will take, until my roof whirl round
With the vertigo: and my dwarf shall dance,
My eunuch sing, my fool make up the antic.
Whilst we, in changed shapes, act Ovid's tales,
Thou, like Europa now, and I like Jove,
Then I like Mars, and thou like Erycine:
So, of the rest, till we have quite run through,
And wearied all the fables of the gods.
Then will I have thee in more modern forms,
Attired like some sprightly dame of France,
Brave Tuscan lady, or proud Spanish beauty;
Sometimes, unto the Persian sophy's wife;
Or the grand signior's mistress; and, for change,
To one of our most artful courtezans,
Or some quick Negro, or cold Russian;
And I will meet thee in as many shapes:
Where we may so transfuse our wandering souls,
Out at our lips, and score up sums of pleasures,
[SINGS.]
That the curious shall not know
How to tell them as they flow;
And the envious, when they find
What there number is, be pined.

CEL: If you have ears that will be pierc'd—or eyes
That can be open'd—a heart that may be touch'd—
Or any part that yet sounds man about you—
If you have touch of holy saints—or heaven—
Do me the grace to let me 'scape—if not,
Be bountiful and kill me.
</pre>

I just think that keeping one browser with heavy extensions, or some old fashioned virtue, would save me from "metamorphic overstimulation" (always threatening). 

On the other hand, I don't want to waste my effort maintaining such virtue (or, by analogy in this case, ensuring that chromium extensions are always running in my browser). There's some question that I could even maintain virtue alone. When I worked as a dishwasher, I was painfully aware that the machine couldn't clean itself, and that *I*, some sort of mysterious external agent to the dishwasher, had to work my way into its innards to refresh the food trap and spray down the wash nozzles themselves.

To really police myself, I'd have to recruit some external agent, differing onto a hierarchical structure I might later regret having gotten wrapped up in.

<pre>
Every day, too, the syndic goes into the street for which he is responsible; stops before each house: gets all the inhabitants to appear at the windows (those who live overlooking the courtyard will be allocated a window looking onto the street at which no one but they may show themselves); he calls each of them by name; informs himself as to the state of each and every one of them - ‘in which respect the inhabitants will be compelled to speak the truth under pain o f death’; if someone does not appear at the window, the syndic must ask why: ‘In this w ay he will find out easily enough whether dead or sick are being concealed. Everyone locked up in his cage, everyone at his window, answering to his name and showing himself when asked - it is the great review of the living and the dead.
</pre>

Well, [Tie me up! Untie me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Xp_9EGz2c)

I *do* think I'll just pack up and move to an OS with one *f-ing* extensible browser. But then, too, I'll probably also have the self-control to get off the internet by 8pm.
