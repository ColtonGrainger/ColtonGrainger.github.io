These are my notes from the [opencourseware version](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm) of [Hal Abelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson)'s *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.

## Motivation

Seems that SICP is one of the canonical starting points for folks interested in compsci with a math background. 

I am coming to the course while simultaneously enrolled in numerical analysis. I'll implement most of the numerical methods in Python, however, I am formalize my understanding of "prescriptive" knowledge (thinking abstractly about algorithms) by learning Scheme.

I'd heard of Scheme as both a parent and child language; I think I will focus on the features that are implemented also in Python. Will I discover that Python is a descendant or cognate?

Here's the burden of context I'm lugging around: 

- Paul Graham's [A Hundred Year Language](http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html)
- Philip Guo's [How I learned programming](http://www.pgbovine.net/how-i-learned-programming.htm)
- [Matt Might's introduction](http://matt.might.net/articles/best-programming-languages/#scheme) to Scheme
- [Matthew Butterick's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMz09jYOgoc) on [Pollen](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/), a typesetting system similar to XML, built on [Racket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language))
  - If Pollen can export to XML, can it be configured to generate interactive manuscripts with [PreTeXt](http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/index.html)?

## Setup

Along with the lectures, I am following a [read-eval-print-loop (REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) in the Jupyter notebook (thanks to joeltg for preparing a [mit-scheme-kernel](https://github.com/joeltg/mit-scheme-kernel)).
