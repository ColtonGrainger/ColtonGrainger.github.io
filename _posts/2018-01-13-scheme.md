My notes for the [open course wear version](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm) of [Hal Abelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson)'s *[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)*.

## Setup 

- Along with the lectures, I am following a [read-eval-print-loop (REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) in the Jupyter notebook.
- Thanks to joeltg for preparing the [mit-scheme-kernel](https://github.com/joeltg/mit-scheme-kernel).
- I am hosting worked examples [through the nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/master/compsci/) and also on [github](https://github.com/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/master/compsci).

## Discussion 

Seems that SICP is a canonical starting point for folks with some math background. 

I'm thinking about the course as a complement to numerical analysis. I want to have a high level view of computing if I'm going to grind away implementing numerical methods in Python.

### goals 

- precise vocabulary to describe algorithms 
- historical context of Python as a descendent of a lisp dialect
  - I'd heard of Scheme as both a parent and child language; I think I will focus on the features that are implemented also in Python. Will I discover that Python is a descendant or cognate?
- prescriptive knowledge

  - If Pollen can export to XML, can it be configured to generate interactive manuscripts with [PreTeXt](http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/index.html)?
