A living document as I progress through the [opencourseware version](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm) of [Hal Abelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson)'s *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.

## Motivation

- [Matt Might's introduction](http://matt.might.net/articles/best-programming-languages/#scheme) to Scheme
- [Matthew Butterick's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMz09jYOgoc) on [Pollen](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/), a typesetting system similar to XML, built on [Racket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language))
  - Open question. If Pollen can export to XML, can it be configured to generate interactive manuscripts with [PreTeXt](http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/index.html)?

## Setup

Along with the lectures, I am following a [read-eval-print-loop (REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) in the Jupyter notebook (thanks to joeltg for implementing a [mit-scheme-kernel](https://github.com/joeltg/mit-scheme-kernel)).
