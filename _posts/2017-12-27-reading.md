While donating books from my old place in Idaho, I noticed a few were rather marked up. I obviously cared the content at the time of reading, but I can't lug around the weight anymore. Here's the bibliography (arranged by topic).

## Wilderness

## Mathematics

## Philosophy

## See also

How do other folks keep track of their reading and plan for more? Depends on their intent. I've noticed book collections posted online tend to be TODO lists, wikis, recommendations, or reviews. 

For example,

- W Caleb's [wiki](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Reading%20List)
- Zhen Zhang's [wiki](https://zhenzhang.me/wiki/booklist.html)
- Matt Might's [Reading for graduate students](http://matt.might.net/articles/books-papers-materials-for-graduate-students/) and [what ever CS major should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/)
- gwern's [book reviews](https://www.gwern.net/Book-reviews)
- cognito mentoring's [core reading recommendations](https://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Core_reading_recommendations)
- Issa Rice's [advice for young people](https://issarice.com/advice-for-young-people#books)
- Philip Guo's [Recommended Reading (from childhood and student years)](http://www.pgbovine.net/reading.htm)
