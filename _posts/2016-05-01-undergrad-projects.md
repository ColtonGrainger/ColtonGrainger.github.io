These are (dated) projects and essays from the College of Idaho. The writing varies, especially Jan 2014 -- May 2015, when I had totally abandoned the idea of writing for an audience.

Galois Theory for Differential Equations, *May 2016* ([poster](docs/galois.pdf))
- Following Michio Kuga's analysis of Fuchsian-type differential equations, I parameterize the solution space of the hypergeometric equation. For interesting cases, I find the monodromy representation at singular points. 

Animal Magnetism, *May 2014* [(preview)](images/animal-magnetism.png) [(pdf)](docs/animal-magnetism.pdf)
- Collages of human and animal bodies, meant as a commentary on William Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying*.
