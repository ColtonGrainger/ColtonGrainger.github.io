## Meta

Why keep this record?

- For motivation. I see musicians as
  - disciplined ([practicing scales](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/64250/do-advanced-musicians-still-practice-scales-every-day/64257#64257), for example)
  - collaborative
  - capable of prolific output
- I wanted to "chew on" a small chunk of data.
- For recreation. I used to DJ and burned out.  
- It's also a personal [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy)---a songbook for seasons and occasions.

Could this page incorporate other media? Illustrations, for example? (Nope, see my [art log](/art-log).)

Lastly, isn't keeping track "hand rolled" sort of tedious? Well, in this way I'm encouraging myself to *pay attention* to the music/art I surround myself with, as historically I've had really wild psychic entropy listening to both EDM music and visual art. 

Doing it by hand for now is fine; it will be harder to get lost in Diplo/Galatica for 6 months.
