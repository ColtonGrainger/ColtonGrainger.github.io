of the Nakba.

## Alternatives

Cindy identified [Zochrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zochrot) as an
organization of folks in Israel/Palestine doing the imaginative work required
to manifest Palestinian refugees' return.

> The word "Zochrot" uses the feminine plural present tense form of the Hebrew verb "to remember", whereas it is customary in Hebrew to use the masculine plural form when referring to a group of people. The feminine form was chosen to signal Zochrot's approach toward the Nakba, which the group says challenges what it sees as the masculine historical narrative by focusing on compassion and inclusion.

I notice, though, (and mentioned to Cindy) that I do not imagine all refugees returning home. At the YMCA International Services in Houston, I was convinced that most clients we served would stay in the United States, as return to their homes seemed dangerous and undesirable. I also cleave to the metaphor "diaspora is entropy". But then who plays the role of [Maxwell's Demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon)? 

I asked Cindy what historical narratives might contribute to my understanding of the feasibility of refugees' [Right of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return). We talked briefly of the Balfour Declaration (promising a Jewish state?) after the division of the Ottoman Empire. Cindy's white hair shook a bit, and I wondered what messages were radio broadcast by Arab militias in 1948. I resolved to review my nineteenth century European History.

Craig gave a one-line alternative: equal human rights for persons in the Palestinian region, including especially [Article 13](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Article_13) of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (Contrast these with [“Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789 - Wikipedia”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_the_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_of_1789).)

> 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State. 
> 2. Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.
