Two schools of thought on the creative process: who am *I* chasing after?  

Inés Estrada, aka [inechi](http://inechi.com/), reps the "I do it for myself" perspective.
> *There's been some recent discussion about balancing art and business, which when you talked about not compromising your art, I was reminded of. What are your objectives? Do you have an audience in mind, and think about salability, or does that come second-after production?*

> I make art because I need to, it's something I do for fun and also for release. If people like it, that's very rewarding,  but in the end the only person I try to please with it is myself. I love the idea of making money out of what I do (and I'm lucky to be able to) but I don't plan my comics considering my audience as customers. I feel like, for me, it's mostly worked out not because I think "I should do shit that sells" but more like "How do I sell this shit I just did?!"

On the other hand, [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net/writings.htm) reps "make it new"
> One heuristic I use when deciding what to write is to ask myself: *Will at least 100 people care about this topic three years from now?* 

> The following don't qualify, so I rarely write about them:
commentary on news events or fads, reactions to someone else's article, personal notes that only my friends would care about. Also, if I see many people writing about a topic, then I avoid it unless I have a drastically different perspective.

If I know where I stood on this spectrum, I'd have nothing more to say. In fact, if [the message is the medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message), then this blog should err towards Philip's conservative heuristic (or creative limitation, depending on your viewpoint). But as Inés gives [compelling counter-examples](http://gatosaurio.com/)---florid .gif art, self-declaration of intent, and apparent *success* as an artist---I am motivated to draw a comparision.

## applied to long-content

If I wrote conversatively, I wouldn't need to worry about "severe edits" (deletion, name changes, and other means of abandoning my identity).

[inechi](http://blog.inechi.com/2017/10/end-of-year-shows.html) describes
> The internet can be overwhelming, specially when you manage different pages and social media things. Sometimes I don't want to have to interact with a post any more and I delete it. The faster the internet becomes, and the more social media tries to emulate quotidianity and the feeling of "hanging out" with other people, the more necessary it becomes for part of the information to be ephemerous. Not everything is relevant enough to be saved permanently in your world wide registry.

Here's an alternative. [Issa Rice](https://issarice.com/long-content) defines 
> Long Content is a style of content creation where one has “perpetual drafts” that one improves over time. This is in contrast to a style where one publishes once and in the long term does not come back to edit/maintain the content.

(In fact, inechi's deletions might just have been rather drastic edits; the viewpoints may permute.)

Issa quotes [Bertrand Russell](http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/howWrite.htm) in defense of *not* rewriting
> I conscientiously tried [to rewrite], but found that my first draft was almost always better than my second. This discovery has saved me an immense amount of time. I do not, of course, apply it to the substance, but only to the form. When I discover an error of an important kind I re-write the whole. What I do not find is that I can improve a sentence when I am satisfied with what it means.

But I'm generally coming at writing/rewriting from an ecological perspective, akin to Gary Synder's "[writing as tracks](https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/The-Practice-of-the-Wild-by-Gary-Snyder.pdf), rather than gwern's "[writing as convergence](https://www.gwern.net/About)". 

## on publishing

So what's at stake? Why not commit to more relentless publication and, consequently, transparency and personal disclosure? Why focus on advancing new ideas (rather than signing karaoke on the old ones)? 
- thinking ecologically, where I stand wrt the [redundancy hyphothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_services#Redundancy_hypothesis)
	- species redundancy enhances ecosystem resilience
	- deletion/link-rot/dying in an abundance ecosystem is legit
	- other players fill my niche, producing a "variation on a theme"
	- relieves anxiety, pressure to "save face"/"defend my ego"
- commitment to an identity 
	- Paul Graham's [Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html)
	- from [The Way of Reticence](https://www.google.com/search?q=Gold+and+jade+endanger+the+house+of+their+possessor)
> Gold and jade endanger the house of their possessor. Wealth and honors lead to arrogance and envy, and bring ruin. Is thy way famous and thy name becoming distinguished? Withdraw, thy work once done, into obscurity; this is the way of Heaven.
- the duration of my conscious experience
	- Peter Theil's anti-aging
	- dying obscure
	- theological considerations?
- how feasible are the permutations?
	- writing/rewriting could *either* converge or diverge
	- why not assume convergence? 
	- or [coarsen up the metric](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/prickles-and-goo/) to guarantee convergence?
- why converge at all?
	- to be respectful of other people's time?
	- why not *just give a disclaimer*
		- "I'm not doing anything"
		- "This is going nowhere"
	- maybe that's self-defeating
	- or maybe, convergence is sort of praiseworthy
- how I feel about [inechi's art](http://inechi.com/Media/)
	- "don't touch me"
	- "don't care"
	- "no more humans"
- fear that writing is shameful 
	- unworthy (that's a moderately religious fear)
	- inappropriate (which is social, cultural)
	- *giftig*, viral (linguistic, even sexual)
