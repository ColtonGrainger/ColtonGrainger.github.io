> Jean Yang: Something I really like about your work is how there's a very strong theoretical foundation, but it's also potentially very useful. I was wondering how you choose the problems to work on.
> 
> Azadeh Farzan: My method is rather personal. I have a first level test that goes like this. If someone would come to me and say that this other person just solved this and there's a talk, would I want to immediately drop everything and go to the talk? The problem being an important and interesting one is naturally an aspect of this.

> The second part has to do with the solution space. I would say that this part is half indulgent. I should really enjoy working in that solution space. By that, I mean the sort of subproblems that need to be solved on the path to addressing the original problem. They should be fun to do. I should not be able to go to bed at night because of I am working on one of them and I just can’t give up. Naturally, things don’t always pan out like that, but by aiming for that, at least about thirty percent of my work ends up being pure joy for me.
