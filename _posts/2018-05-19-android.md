What I want on my phone.

- recently updated music
- podcasts from an rss feed
- my mnemosyne database

(Now that I think about it, my phone *could* be a little mirror of the reading / lectures on my laptop. If I hammer out the music updating workflow, then it'd make no difference to ship over the pdfs as well.)

The naming convention is (sort of) `%y-%b-%n-%a-%t`:

    YEAR-ALBUM-TRACK-ARTIST-TITLE.EXT
    2015-NumericalMethods-01-LyudmylaBarannyk-MATH428SP15SESSION1.mp4

## mounting and unmounting

- `mkdir ~/android_mount` (if needed)
- connect by USB
- `jmtpfs ~/android_mount`
- file operations
- `fusermount -u ~/android_mount`

[Don't use sudo](https://wiki.debian.org/mtp).
