This page accompanies [Math 428: Numerical Methods](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~barannyk/Teaching/Math428.html) as taught by Lyudmyla Barannyk (Spring 2018 through the University of Idaho). I've also included a survey of SICP as related to designing and interpreting algorithms.

## Algorithm Design and Interpretation

This section contains notes on the open courseware version of [MIT course number 6.001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm).

Along with the lectures, I am following a [read-eval-print-loop (REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) in the Jupyter notebook. (Thanks to joeltg for preparing the [mit-scheme-kernel](https://github.com/joeltg/mit-scheme-kernel).)

Seems that SICP is a canonical starting point for folks with some math background. 

I'm thinking about the course as a complement to numerical analysis. I want to have a high level view of computing if I'm going to grind away implementing numerical methods in Python.

### goals 

- precise vocabulary to describe algorithms 
- historical context of Python as a descendent of a lisp dialect
  - I'd heard of Scheme as both a parent and child language; I think I will focus on the features that are implemented also in Python. Will I discover that Python is a descendant or cognate?
- prescriptive knowledge
