This page accompanies [Math 428: Numerical Methods](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~barannyk/Teaching/Math428.html) as taught by Lyudmyla Barannyk (Spring 2018 through the University of Idaho). I dragged this course well into the summer. [Notebook here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/fy18num/).

## Algorithm design and interpretation

Here're notes from a survey of SICP for designing and interpreting algorithms.

I referenced the open courseware version of [MIT 6.001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm). 

I loaded joeltg's [mit-scheme-kernel](https://github.com/joeltg/mit-scheme-kernel) into a jupyter notebook for [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)'n.

(Seems that SICP is a canonical starting point for folks with some math background. I'm thinking about the course as a complement to numerical analysis. I want to have a high level view of computing if I'm going to grind away implementing numerical methods.)

### goals

- precise vocabulary to describe algorithms 
- historical context of Python as a descendent lisp dialect?

  - I'd heard of Scheme as both a parent and child language; I think I will focus on the features that are implemented also in Python. Will I discover
    that Python is a descendant or cognate?

- prescriptive knowledge

- If Pollen can export to XML, can it be configured to generate interactive manuscripts with [PreTeXt](http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/index.html)?
