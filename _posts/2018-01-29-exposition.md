To hone my own writing, I'm massing a collection of articles on exposition.
Presently, I see exposition as the cumulative result of different processes (i)
whiteboard (palimpsest) style notation, (ii) conversational jargon, and (iii)
mental alignment with both physical and ideal (Platonic) metaphors.

I'm into the metaphor "research-debt is poorly laid out mountain trail".
[Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) from
[Distill](https://distill.pub/). To play along 
[ecological lines](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511203300/http://www.ecology.ethz.ch/education/master-courses/readings-in-environmental-thinking.html):

- Hiking in Scotland, I remember curling up under eroded mudbanks and romping
  through wet heather. Felt like I could jump and twist into the sodden ground.
  I'm fine paying homage, making a pilgrimage, whatever.

- Is exposition poor because folks don't want intruders? I think not.

- I'll advocate for an "intellectual terrain" metaphor (or ecosystem, as in
  Adbusters' mental environment). In this case, the topography (Platonic,
  mathematical reality) is self-regulating, fecund, wild, and good exposition
  is characterized by companionship.

## meta

Philip Guo warns against reading all day. However, in regards to reading
exposition, I can afford to survey and be choosy.

My own exposition has hierarchical formality:

- mental notes, biological noise
- self-expression
- written notes to be unpacked
- post written to small group
- terse instructions, for a broad audience
