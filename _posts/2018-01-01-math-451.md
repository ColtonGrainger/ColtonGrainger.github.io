My review for Math 451: Probability Theory, taken Fall 2017 as a correspondence course through the University of Idaho.

I wrote up my [coursework](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/master/probability/) in jupyter notebooks, though didn't really need to make computations. So the notebooks were a mix of awkward typesetting and a couple of calls on the `scipy` package. I used Bruce Shapiro's [Scientific Computation](http://calculuscastle.com/pythonbook.html) for the python scripting.

[Chris Remien](https://web.archive.org/web/20170616205624/http://webpages.uidaho.edu/cremien/math451EO/)'s lectures could have been more organized. Similarly, our textbook *Stochastic Modeling and Mathematical Statistics* by Francisco J. Samaniego wanted for structure. 

To complement the colloquial lectures and text, I heavily referenced Paul Pfeiffer's *[Probability for Applications](https://books.google.com/books?id=UlThBwAAQBAJ)*. I prefer deliberately thinking about random variables as inverse images, which Pfeiffer's exposition makes plain.
