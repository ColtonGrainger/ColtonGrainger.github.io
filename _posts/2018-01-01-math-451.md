I review 
[Math 451: Probability Theory](https://web.archive.org/web/20170616205624/http://webpages.uidaho.edu/cremien/math451EO/)
as taught by Chris Remein. This was a correspondence course I took through the
University of Idaho Fall 2017.

I wrote up my
[coursework](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/ master/old/probability/) 
in jupyter notebooks, though didn't really need to
make computations. The notebooks were a mix of (quite) awkward typesetting and a
couple of calls from `scipy`. I used Bruce Shapiro's 
[Scientific Computation](http://calculuscastle.com/pythonbook.html) as a
guide.

Remien's lectures could have been organized. Similarly, our textbook
*Stochastic Modeling and Mathematical Statistics* by Francisco J. Samaniego
wanted for structure.

To complement the colloquial lectures and text, I referenced Paul Pfeiffer's 
*[Probability for Applications](https://books.google.com/books?id=UlThBwAAQBAJ)*. 
I prefer deliberately thinking about random variables as inverse images, which
Pfeiffer's exposition makes plain.
