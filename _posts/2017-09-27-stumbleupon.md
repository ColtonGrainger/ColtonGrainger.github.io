I reflect on how kids at the shelter are using the public computer. I propose two moves towards digital literacy.

# experience at shelter

I've noticed the kids weren't actually playing computer games, but rather watching YouTube videos of other users playing. So, after having enough YouTube, I introduced 4 of the kids to StumbleUpon. We choose interest categories, including, namely, *fashion* (an immediate and nearly unianimous decision), *drawing*, *New York*, *cooking*, *music*, and *pets*.

I'm particularly proud we found:
- [typedrummer.com](www.typedrummer.com) (an ascii text beat machine)
- [redrabbit7.com](redrabbit7.org) (oil paintings of cityscapes)
- [weavesilk.com](weavesilk.com) (a symmetric interactive sketch pad)

Having seen a glimmer of hope, I now have to goal to ween the kids off of YouTube and flassgames. 

Without a framework to save their progress, I am concerned that the little users will be discouraged by forays into a internet of advertising and random, instantly gratifying flash games (the highest offender of which is presently agar.io). They'll be stuck in windown shopping mode if I can't load some software onto that computer: never entering, but rather wandering as homeless flaneurs. The impacts on working memory seem to be apparent: frequently broken concentration, a sense of overwhelming futility, and a disregard of personal agency in "making the computer work".

When I was a 6th grader, I had installed LimeWire (to pirate the American Idiot album), Line Rider, and the N-game. And earlier, I had the Pokemon Saphire through Emerald as thick texts to follow along with and struggle against and build something out of. (But did I not miss out on Oblivion? the Legend of Zelda?)

How can I create license for the kids here? How can I usher the kids into digital literacy (beyond button mashing)?

1. I can suggest flash games that allow a user to create their *own* space. For me, two transitional games were
- Junkbot Undercover (which is no longer on lego.com) and 
- Motherload (produced by XGen, of which I had pirated the Goldium edition)

because both allowed a user to save their progress. 
2. Also, I can push the kids to browse other sites  (i.e., isn't there another site outside of YouTube you'd like to visit?) and make referrals to "quality" flash games (as I define them).I might be able to usher the kids into digital literacy (beyond button mashing).
