# experience at shelter

I've noticed the kids weren't actually playing computer games, but rather watching youtube videos of other users playing. So, after having enought YouTube at shelter, I introduced 4 of the kids to stumbleupon. We choose interest categories, including, namely, *fashion* (an immediate and nearly unianimous decision), *drawing*, *New York*, *cooking*, *music*, and *pets*.

I'm particularly proud we found:
- typedrummer.com (an ascii text beat machine)
- redrabbit7.com (oil paintings of cityscapes)
- weavesilk.com (a symmetric interactive sketch pad)

I have a goal to ween the kiddos off of flash games. Anyways, what are the impacts to working memory of playing only games that do not save? I imagine: broken concentration and a feeling of overwhelming futility. After irritation subsides, I feel that a child defaults to *starting over* to accomplish any computational task (i.e., from mashing the keyboard to reopening the internet browser).

Without a framework to save their progress, I am concerned that our little users will be discouraged by forays into a internet of advertising and random, instantly gratifying flash games (the highest offender of which is presently agar.io). They'll be stuck in windown shopping mode if I can't load some software onto that computer. When I was a 6th grader, I had installed LimeWire (to pirate the American Idiot album), Line Rider, and the N-game. And earlier, I had the Pokemon Saphire through Emerald as rich games to follow along with and struggle against and build myself into a real trainer.

How can I bring that sort of license to the kids here? I think that I can suggest flash games that allow a user to create their *own* space. For me, two transitional games were
- Junkbot Undercover (which is no longer on lego.com)
- Motherload (produced by XGen, of which I had pirated the Goldium edition)
because both allowed a user to save their progress. Starting with little suggestions (like, isn't there another site outside of YouTube you'd like to visit?) and referrals to "quality" flash games, I might be able to usher the kids into digital literacy (beyond button mashing).
