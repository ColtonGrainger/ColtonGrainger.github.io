I aim to use a directory tree that is legible, recoverable, and easily secured.

## questions for now

- What's the standard UNIX directory tree? 
- Which files should be public? private? somewhere between indiscrete and discrete?
	- e.g., collaborative documents to be shared with only a working group?
	- see Matt Might's [CRAPL](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl) (an academic strength open source license).
- To use cloud storage?
	- Evernote? (might encourage hoarding)
	- "a hand rolled wiki"? (preferred, something to learn anyways, and I can always switch to evernote after having the experience of doing it myself.)
- What about pairing a directory tree with an established taxonomy?
	- e.g., d'Alembert's taxonomy of knowledge in the Encyclopedie
	- the Math Subject Classification
	- broad categories: projects, life, private 

## chronological vs taxonomic organization

I think CV style personal organization is fine. In order to get on with life, it seems natural to associate old projects with specific age ranges (high school, undergrad, etc).

At the same time, *anything* I intend to be public should *not* be chronologically ordered, but located and labelled in a taxonomy of knowledge.

Therefore, in creating any new files, I initially establish whether that file is public or private. I'll concentrate organization efforts on the public side (since I have little reason to pretty up private information for other folks).

I think useful private categories (private simply because these matters are *so noisey*, being right against the quotidian grind of physical existence) include health, finance, and residency documents.
