I aim to use a directory tree that is legible, recoverable, and easily secured.

## questions for now

- What's the standard UNIX directory tree? 
- Which files should be public? private? somewhere between indiscrete and discrete?
	- e.g., collaborative documents to be shared with only a working group?
	- see Matt Might's [CRAPL](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl) (an academic strength open source license).
- To use cloud storage?
	- Evernote? (might encourage hoarding)
	- "a hand rolled wiki"? (preferred, something to learn anyways, and I can always switch to evernote after having the experience of doing it myself.)
- What about pairing a directory tree with an established taxonomy? 
	- e.g., d'Alembert's taxonomy of knowledge in the Encyclopedie
	- the Math Subject Classification
	- broad categories: projects, life, private
