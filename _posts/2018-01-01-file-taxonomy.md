title: Directory Trees and File Taxonomy

I aim to use a directory tree that is legible, recoverable, and easily secured.

## questions for now

- Which files should be public? private? somewhere between indiscrete and discrete?
    - e.g., collaborative documents to be shared with only a working group?
    - see Matt Might's [CRAPL](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl) (an academic strength open source license).
- To use cloud storage?
    - Evernote? (might encourage hoarding)
    - "a hand rolled wiki"? (preferred, something to learn anyways, and I can always switch to evernote after having the experience of doing it myself.)
- What about pairing a directory tree with an established taxonomy?
    - e.g., d'Alembert's taxonomy of knowledge in the Encyclopedie
    - broad categories: projects, life, private
- or using tags, e.g., with [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:coltongrainger)
    - arXiv tags [cs](https://arxiv.org/archive/cs), [math](https://arxiv.org/archive/math), [quant-ph](https://arxiv.org/archive/quant-ph)
    - Math Subject Classification

## chronological vs taxonomic organization

I think CV style personal organization is fine. In order to get on with life, it seems natural to associate old projects with specific age ranges (high school, undergrad, etc).

At the same time, anything I intend to be public should be located and labelled in a taxonomy of knowledge. 

Update: I made a pretty decent TODO taxonomy summer 2018. It regulates and prioritizes the level one headers of org-mode `todo.org` file.[^simon]

[^simon]: The broader question, how to group signs and other utterances is still open, and it seems, the answer is only getting further away.

    From Simon Joyner's 2005 *Traint to Crazy Horse*:

    > I was born as a blessing, but I'll go out as a curse...\
    > I believe everything is an incantation...\

- health
- finance
- career
- research
- ...classes...
- teaching
- service
- chores
- config
- unsorted

I think it's wise to initially establish[^inventory] whether the output is public or private. One can then concentrate organizational efforts on public matters (since I have little reason to pretty up private information for other folks, and I'm fine using arcane categories for myself). 

[^inventory]: Taking an exhaustive personal inventory is a good place to start.

Useful private categories include health, finance, and residency. All things *noisey*, *quotidian*, and *grinding*. :)
