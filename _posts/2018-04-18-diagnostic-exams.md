title: Diagnostic Exams in Algebra and Analysis

Having a comparatively weak undergraduate background, I recognize I need to
build as much mathematical momentum as possible leading up to my qualifying
exams at CU Boulder. As a first step I, here, highlight portions of the
department's expectations for incoming PhD students, and list resources to prep
for an initial diagnostic exam in algebra and analysis.

> The diagnostic exam is offered in the summer before a student starts and
> consists of two parts: algebra and analysis, both of which are based on the
> material in a typical first-semester undergraduate course. The goal is to
> establish how prepared students from widely varying backgrounds are for
> particular graduate courses.
> 
> On the basis of the exam results, the Graduate Committee will recommend that
> the student either register for the graduate courses or that the student take
> a lower-level course to make up for deficiencies. Typical recommendations are
> Math 5140 or Math 5150 (for algebra) and Math 5001 or APPM 5440 (for
> analysis). Although the exam is mandatory, the recommendations are only
> advisory, and the student may choose not to follow them.

> All students must pass Algebra 1 (Math 6130), Algebra 3 (Math 6140), Analysis
> 1 (Math 6310), Analysis 2 (Math 6320), Topology 2 (Math 6210), Differential
> Geometry 1 (Math 6230), and Complex Analysis 2 (Math 6350) with a grade of B-
> or better in each. The only exceptions are for students who unconditionally
> pass the corresponding preliminary exam (Algebra, Analysis, or
> Topology/Geometry); students who pass conditionally must complete the full
> pillar sequence. Students who have taken similar courses elsewhere may
> petition the Graduate Committee to obtain an exemption. 

> The three "pillar sequences" are Algebra 1 and 2, Analysis 1 and 2, and
> Topology 1/Geometry 1. At least one pillar sequence must be completed by the
> end of the first year. We recommend completing at least two by the end of the
> first year. All three pillar sequences must be completed by the end of the
> second year. Complex Analysis (Math 6350) must be passed by the end of the
> semester in which the student passes the Comprehensive Exam, which must happen
> by the end of the seventh semester.

I'm inspired foremost by Michael Pacer, who I understand to have taken up the
challenge of "producing something of potential worth for others" with gusto in
his own preparations for qualifying exams in cognitive science.

Pacer scanned 19 field notebooks of responses to each article on an ambitious
reading list.

Tangible.

I imagine purchasing a large scanner (50-page capacity) to drop my sheets of
notes into at the end of each day. I think scanning in notes would be a bit
more chronological than organizing the notebooks from memory by hand. 

If I'm going to ape Pacer, I want to be explicit that I want the records to
*look good* after the fact. I think keeping a flat hierarchy of between
different low-barrier media would be sufficient as a "product" of value to
others. 

Media to use:

- jupyter notebooks for computational examples
- podcasts? interviews? (transcribed)
- text files in pandoc markdown
- dated scans of handwritten notes
  - letter paper, folded long into 2 columns

I'm missing a $\TeX$ formatting template, especially for bibliographies.

One remedy would be to import administrative skill from [Matt
Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/books-papers-materials-for-graduate-students/).
