Having a comparatively weak undergraduate background, I recognize I need to
build as much mathematical momentum as possible leading up to my qualifying
exams at CU Boulder. As a first step I, here, highlight portions of the
department's expectations for incoming PhD students, and list resources to prep
for an initial diagnostic exam in algebra and analysis.

> The diagnostic exam is offered in the summer before a student starts and
> consists of two parts: algebra and analysis, both of which are based on the
> material in a typical first-semester undergraduate course. The goal is to
> establish how prepared students from widely varying backgrounds are for
> particular graduate courses.
> 
> On the basis of the exam results, the Graduate Committee will recommend that
> the student either register for the graduate courses or that the student take
> a lower-level course to make up for deficiencies. Typical recommendations are
> Math 5140 or Math 5150 (for algebra) and Math 5001 or APPM 5440 (for
> analysis). Although the exam is mandatory, the recommendations are only
> advisory, and the student may choose not to follow them.

> All students must pass Algebra 1 (Math 6130), Algebra 3 (Math 6140), Analysis
> 1 (Math 6310), Analysis 2 (Math 6320), Topology 2 (Math 6210), Differential
> Geometry 1 (Math 6230), and Complex Analysis 2 (Math 6350) with a grade of B-
> or better in each. The only exceptions are for students who unconditionally
> pass the corresponding preliminary exam (Algebra, Analysis, or
> Topology/Geometry); students who pass conditionally must complete the full
> pillar sequence. Students who have taken similar courses elsewhere may
> petition the Graduate Committee to obtain an exemption. 

> The three "pillar sequences" are Algebra 1 and 2, Analysis 1 and 2, and
> Topology 1/Geometry 1. At least one pillar sequence must be completed by the
> end of the first year. We recommend completing at least two by the end of the
> first year. All three pillar sequences must be completed by the end of the
> second year. Complex Analysis (Math 6350) must be passed by the end of the
> semester in which the student passes the Comprehensive Exam, which must happen
> by the end of the seventh semester.
