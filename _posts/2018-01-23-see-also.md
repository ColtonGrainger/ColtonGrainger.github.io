Few of my ideas are original, especially those dealing with the material design
and organization of this site.

Thanks for style sheets, existential motivation, and technical HOWTOs:

+ [Issa Rice](http://issarice.com)
    - Much credit to Issa Rice for forging a really crisp style sheet. (I even
      use a variant of the headers when taking notes by hand.) I've pulled
      multiple features from his site: headers, CC0 licensing, and general
      modus operandi.

Thanks for encouragement:

Thanks for feedback on tone, voice, and *making human*
