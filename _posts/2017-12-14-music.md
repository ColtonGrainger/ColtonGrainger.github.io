## Meta

Why keep this record?
- For motivation. I see musicians as
	- disciplined ([practicing scales](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/64250/do-advanced-musicians-still-practice-scales-every-day/64257#64257), for example)
	- collaborative
	- capable of prolific output
- I wanted to "chew on" a small chunk of data.
	- todo: categorize music with a dynamic table
	- php to query? working with [tables](https://issarice.com/tabular-presentation)?
- For recreation. I used to DJ and burned out.  

I would like to "reverse-mine" data from the [Hype Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_Machine), which itself is a aggregate of music mined from the larger [blogosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere).

Could this page incorperate other media? Illustrations, for example?

> *Erkennen wir in der Tragödie einen durchgreifenden Stilgegensatz: 
> Sprache, Farbe, Beweglichkeit, Dynamik der Rede treten 
> in der dionysischen Lyrik des Chors und andrerseits in 
> der apollinischen Traumwelt der Scene als völlig 
> gesonderte Spren des Ausdrucks aus einander.*[^tragodie]

> We find in tragedy an unmanagable contrast of style: 
> speech, color, flexibility, the power of telling manifest 
> in the dionysian lyric of the chorus and, on the other hand, 
> in the apollonian dreamworld of the scene, 
> as totally separate spheres of expression.

[^tragodie]: Nietzsche, [Die Geburt der Tragödie](https://archive.org/stream/diegeburtdertrag00niet/diegeburtdertrag00niet_djvu.txt), 1886
