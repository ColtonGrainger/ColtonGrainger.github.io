title: Engaged Learning and Job Development in Western Washington 
author: Colton Grainger

For now, this is a rough collection of thoughts and statistics on early education, "engaged learning" and job development in [Western Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Washington) (specifically the PacMtn region, i.e., Thurston, Lewis, Grays Harbor, Pacific, and Mason counties).

## engaged learning workgroup

Jane compiled [labor market info for the PacMtn Region](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coltongrainger/work/master/public/curriculum/2017-pacmtn-jobs-data.csv), to share. I added "STEM" and "STEM-literate" fields and consolated the csv file. Jane encourages folks to *visit O-net* for job descriptions, after isolating an occupation.

Her boilerplate reads: 
> Entry Points 2017 is built on economic resources that are publicly
> available on various state and federal websites.
> 
> **Job Zones** are defined as different levels of education and
> preparation for the job market. There are five job zones:
> 
> -   Job Zone 1 focuses on “on the job training”, requiring limited
>     formal educational training
> -   Job Zone 2 usually requires a HS diploma and perhaps some
>     specialized training
> -   Job Zone 3 requires vocational school training, on the job
>     experience and/or certification
> -   Job Zone 4 usually requires a four-year college degree
> -   Job Zone 5 requires a post four-year college degree plus
>     certifications and/or passing professional level tests
> 
> For a comprehensive explanation, check out:

> 
> **SOC code** and **Occupational titles:** Employers often organize their
> staff and identify the work of staff around the marketing language of
> the product and services they are providing to their customers; thus,
> job titles for similar work activities will vary among employers.
> 
> In O\*Net, these jobs are organized around common skills, and identified
> by a six-digit Standard Occupational Code (SOC code). Check out
> <http://www.onetonline.org/> . In the upper right-hand corner, type in a
> job title or SOC code to see a comprehensive explanation of a particular
> skill-set.
> 
> SOC codes identified as STEM jobs (Science, Technology, Engineering and
> Math) are noted with the **orange** background; STEM LITERACY jobs are
> noted with the **green** background: per Washington STEM at
> [www.washingtonstem.org/](http://www.washingtonstem.org/) and explained
> in “Assessing Labor Market Data: Guidebook”.
> 
> A list of all training programs is posted on the Career Bridge website;
> click: <http://www.careerbridge.wa.gov>. Click on **Find Education;**
> then **All Job Titles**; then **Search**.
> 
> **Estimated Employment 2015Q2**: Statistical surveys are conducted with
> employers throughout the year. The employment pattern in the second
> quarter is preferred; it is less impacted by seasonality
> (Winter/Summer/holidays).
> 
> These estimations do not include the self-employed, owner/partners in
> unincorporated firms, the military, household workers or unpaid family
> workers. Estimates for some occupations or wage levels may be suppressed
> due to small sample size, i.e. fewer than 10 people.
> 
> **Staff Turnover:** is a measure of **Average annual total openings
> 2016Q2-2018Q2:** Economists factor in staffing turnovers reported by
> employers in the preceding year and then apply industry forecasts for
> the coming year. For a comprehensive explanation, check out:
> <https://fortress.wa.gov/esd/employmentdata/reports-publications/industry-reports/employment-projections>
> 
> **Entry Hourly Wage, Median Hourly Wage and Skilled Hourly Wage:** data
> is based on the 25^th,^ 50^th\\ and^ 75^th^ percentiles respectively.
> **Average** **Annual Wage:** is the median wage covering 2,080 hours of
> work, a 40-hour work week, over the period of one year. Educators
> typically work on an annual contract.
> 
> Statistical studies group Thurston County as one Metropolitan
> Statistical Area (MSA), and Lewis, Mason, Pacific, and Grays Harbor &
> Wahkiakum Counties as a separate non-MSA.

> To **Find Employers**: click on

From Paul Graham's [Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)
> Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.

> As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager is coeval with suburbia. I don't think this is a coincidence. I think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they're made to lead. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere.[^nerds]
