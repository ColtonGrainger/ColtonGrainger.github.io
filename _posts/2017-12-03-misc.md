Who am I chasing after?

## debate on long-content

From [inechi](http://blog.inechi.com/2017/10/end-of-year-shows.html):
> The internet can be overwhelming, specially when you manage different pages and social media things. Sometimes I don't want to have to interact with a post any more and I delete it. The faster the internet becomes, and the more social media tries to emulate quotidianity and the feeling of "hanging out" with other people, the more necessary it becomes for part of the information to be ephemerous. Not everything is relevant enough to be saved permanently in your world wide registry.

From [Issa Rice](https://issarice.com/long-content)
> Long Content is a style of content creation where one has “perpetual drafts” that one improves over time. This is in contrast to a style where one publishes once and in the long term does not come back to edit/maintain the content.

Issa also quotes [Bertrand Russell](http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/howWrite.htm) in defense of *not* rewriting
> I conscientiously tried [to rewrite], but found that my first draft was almost always better than my second. This discovery has saved me an immense amount of time. I do not, of course, apply it to the substance, but only to the form. When I discover an error of an important kind I re-write the whole. What I do not find is that I can improve a sentence when I am satisfied with what it means.

But I'm generally coming at writing/rewriting from an ecological perspective, akin to Gary Synder's "[writing as tracks](, rather than gwern's "[writing as convergence](https://www.gwern.net/About)". 

So what's at stake? On what ground will I change my opinion?
- the degree to which I am comfortable with an obscure death
- thinking ecologically, where I stand wrt the [redundancy hyphothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_services#Redundancy_hypothesis)
	- species redundancy enhances ecosystem resilience
	- deletion/link-rot/dying in an abundance ecosystem is legit
	- other players fill my niche, producing a "variation on a theme"
	- relieves anxiety, pressure to "save face"/"defend my ego"
- the size of my identity
	- Paul Graham's [Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html)
	- [The Way of Reticence](https://www.google.com/search?q=Gold+and+jade+endanger+the+house+of+their+possessor)
> Gold and jade endanger the house of their possessor. Wealth and honors lead to arrogance and envy, and bring ruin. Is thy way famous and thy name becoming distinguished? Withdraw, thy work once done, into obscurity; this is the way of Heaven.
- the duration of my conscious experience
- how feasible are the permutations?
	- writing/rewriting could *either* converge or diverge
	- why not assume convergence? or [coarsen up the metric](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/prickles-and-goo/) to guarantee convergence?
- why converge at all?
	- to be respectful of other people's time?
	- why not just give a disclaimer: 
		- I'm not doing anything? 
		- This is going nowhere?
	- maybe that's self-defeating.
- how I feel about [inechi's art](http://inechi.com/Media/)
	- "don't touch me"
	- "don't care"
	- "no more humans"
- shame, fear, abandonment; how these emotions rank rationally with global hunger, etc
