What I've noticed is that this year I have developed more incomplete work than any other year in my life. I spend a little time in a video to reflect on *incompleteness* and to outline a plan to conclude a year of service.

## Why is this a vlog?

1. A *vlog* relects my circumstances. Since joining the Episcopal Service Corps, I haven't much access to written material or much time to grapple with text.
  - Libraries on the northside of Houston just close too early.
  - I devote a significant amount of energy to my commute.
  - The service corps house and my work site have too much going on.
  - When I find time, I usually write notes to myself or letters to peers and mentors (nothing for a broad audience).

2. Fortunately, vlogs and podcasts have carried me through this desert of texts. I have a bunch of newfound respect for versatile media---it's accessible! 

3. Lastly, I'm enthusiastic about forcing myself to learn work with mulitmedia.
