Since August, my two main concerns have been status and overhead. I'm taken up with status because it's new to me. Prior to Boulder, I was in Olympia, and I didn't interact with anyone in person who actually *put me into rank*. At the same time, I'm newly stressed out by overhead both in the elliptical sense (expenses incurred) and as in fencing (over my head). Perhaps I could have take stronger prerequisites? Or exerted myself more consistently prior to the start of the semester?

To make a skeleton argument for as why both concerns are frivolous and distracting:

- Status

    - culture shock? backwoods to Boulder?
    - botched the neural network podcast
    - promotional motivation and timeliness
    - biking without enough sleep and breaking my hand

- Overhead

    - coming with less technical knowledge in algebra than was good for me
    - how to communicate with my peers? folks senior to me? 
        - faux pas and over-enthusiasm
    - TA-ing
        - somewhat less valuable to me, but I was more expectant

Each of the 5 days before finals I felt decent: I could work all day, I was competing directly with myself, and I wasn't responsible for new material. I had also settled into a paper-based workflow. I carried around a few notebooks with as many practice exams as I needed, and I largely stopped updating my notebook. Lastly, I managed to secure a reference letter before opening and taking the algebra final. Asking for a letter left me feeling strangely elated: 

- I had to look squarely at my stack rank against other folks in my cohort, which I had been avoiding the whole year. 
- But I was given a green light to send my applications materials and proceed, after which I had quite a bit of preventional motivation to slog through my algebra exam.

With any luck, next semester I'll successfully ignore my status and bring down some of my overheads.
