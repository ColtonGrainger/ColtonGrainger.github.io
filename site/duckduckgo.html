Both editions continue to sell briskly and are widely cited inthe scientific literature. However, with the many advances in the theory, computation and application of special functions that have occurred since 1960, a new standard reference is badly needed. NIST intends to satisfy this need by providing a Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) as a free Web site together with an associated book and CD-ROM.”</li>
  <li>nLab ` !nl or !ncatlab ` <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLab">“nLab - Wikipedia”</a>. English Wikipedia. “The nLab is a wiki for research-level notes, expositions and collaborative work, including original research, in mathematics, physics, and philosophy, with a focus on methods from category theory and homotopy theory. The nLab espouses the “n-point of view” (a deliberate pun on Wikipedia’s “neutral point of view”) that category theory and particularly higher n-category theory provide a useful unifying viewpoint for mathematics, physics and philosophy. The nLab is listed on MathOverflow as a standard online mathematics reference to check before asking questions. Many questions and answers link to the nLab for background material. It is one of two wikis mentioned by the mathematical physicist John C. Baez in his review of math blogs for the American Mathematical Society.”</li>
  <li>Physics Forums `  !physics ` <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/help/aboutus/">“About Physics Forums”</a>. “Our goal is to provide a community for people (whether students, professional scientists, or hobbyists) to learn and discuss science as it is currently generally understood and practiced by the professional scientific community. As our name suggests, our main focus is on physics, but we also have forums for most other academic areas including engineering, chemistry, biology, social sciences, etc. Physics help along with math help and other sciences is available for students.”</li>

  <li>The Complexity Zoo ` !cz `  <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Zoo_Intro">“Complexity Zoo Introduction - Complexity Zoo”</a>. “The sprawling web of known relations among complexity classes - containments, oracle separations, random oracle separations, lowness results, the occasional inequality - is not fixed in my memory like the English language. And so it’s largely for my own benefit that I recorded a chunk of what’s known in one unwieldy HTML file.The second audience is other theorists and theory students, who might find the Zoo to have a few advantages as a reference. First, inspired by Eric Weisstein’s famed World of Mathematics, it links liberally between entries. Second, it can be updated regularly - much of its current content is not yet in any book as far as I know. Third, it takes a democratic approach to complexity classes, with big hitters like NP listed alongside the lesser-known mAL, PODN, and QACC0. Any class is fair game so long as something nontrivial has been said about it in the literature.”</li>
  <li>The Online Encyclopedia Of Integer Sequences ` !seq ` <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences">“On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences - Wikipedia”</a>.
