# Colton Grainger

This is my (Colton Grainger's) personal website. My intention here is to [share notes](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) and [journal entries](/journal-keeping), to develop a relationship with an implied reader[^who], and to concentrate my efforts on clearly delinated goals. 

I warmly appreciate others who've modeled online presence; until I develop my own sufficiently, it's useful to note that I am largely following in their footsteps (see [people](/links)).

[^who]: For [Wolfgang Iser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Iser), the *implied reader* is "a textual structure anticipating the presence of a recipient without necessarily defining [them]â€¦the concept of the implied reader designates a network of response-inviting structures, which impel the reader to grasp the text."

## Fall 2017 Summary
I am coordinating the [volunteer program](http://coltongrainger.com/fscss-volunteers) for a family homeless shelter in Olympia, WA. 

Additionally, I am reviewing [Probabilty](http://webpages.uidaho.edu/cremien/math451EO/) and [Ordinary Differential Equations](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~barannyk/Teaching/Math310.html).
