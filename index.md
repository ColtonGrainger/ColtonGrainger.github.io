# Colton Grainger

I am an applicant to PhD programs in Mathematics, currently finishing 2 years of service work as a [community organizer](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work) in Olympia, WA. I received my bachelor's degree from The College of Idaho in 2016.

My research interests are in algebraic topology, the design of algorithms for topological data analysis, and collaborative data science. See also my [personal statement](/personal-statement) and [survey of schools](/grad-school).

This site is an activity feed and an [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html). I post under [all-pages](all-pages).
