# Colton Grainger

This is my personal website. It's an [open
notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) and a collection
of links to other sites. For a "blog-roll" see [people](/see-also#people).

## February 2018 Summary

I am a [community organizer](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work) for a
family shelter in Olympia, WA. This month's projects included
 - coordinating [farm day care](fscss-volunteers/farm-day-care),
 - developing volunteer [training curriculum](fscss-volunteers/wiki), and
 - improving our [internship program](fscss-volunteers/practicum).

My service term ends August 2018, after which I aim to get more involved in
Applied Mathematics (see [schools I applied to](/grad-schools) and my
[personal statement](/personal-statement)). In this direction, my recent work
includes
 - starting a jupyter notebook [activity
   feed](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/master/),
 - configuring relevant [dotfiles](https://github.com/coltongrainger/dotfiles),
 - migrating to Emacs Org-mode, and
 - studying [numerical methods](/math-428).
