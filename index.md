# Colton Grainger

This is my (Colton Grainger's) personal website; it's both an [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) and an ongoing conversation with an implied reader. 

For [Wolfgang Iser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Iser), the *implied reader* is 
> a textual structure anticipating the presence of a recipient without necessarily defining [them]â€¦the concept of the implied reader designates a network of response-inviting structures, which impel the reader to grasp the text.

I appreciate others who've modeled online presence. For credit, see [people](/links).


## Fall 2017 Summary
I am coordinating a [volunteer program](http://coltongrainger.com/fscss-volunteers) for a family homeless shelter in Olympia, WA. 

I am also reviewing [Probabilty](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/master/probability/) and [Ordinary Differential Equations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/master/odes/).
