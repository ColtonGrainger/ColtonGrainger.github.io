# Colton Grainger

This is the personal website of myself, Colton Grainger. It is an activity feed and an [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html). I post under [all-pages](all-pages).

Fall 2018, I will be joining the University of Colorado in Boulder as a PhD student in Mathematics. I received my bachelor's degree from The College of Idaho in 2016.

My research interests are in algebraic topology, namely persistent homology and the design of algorithms for topological data analysis. See also my [personal statement](/personal-statement).

## Summary of What I Worked on: April 2018

With the end of cold weather shelter, I finished my service as a [community organizer](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work) in Olympia, WA. Some highlights included piloting [farm day care](fscss-volunteers/farm-day-care), improving shelter [safety](fscss-volunteers/wiki#safety) and [privacy](https://github.com/coltongrainger/fscss/blob/master/curriculum/2018-04-12-privacy.md), and setting up a framework for a [work-study/internship program](fscss-volunteers/practicum) with Evergreen and St. Martin's University.

Related to mathematics and scientific computing, see my [Jupyter notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coltongrainger/notebooks/tree/master/), my course review of [numerical methods](/math-428), or my current technical configuration ([dotfiles](https://github.com/coltongrainger/dotfiles), [software](/software)).
