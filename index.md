# Colton Grainger

This Fall I will be joining the University of Colorado in Boulder as a PhD student in Mathematics. I received my bachelor's degree from The College of Idaho in 2016.

My research interests are in algebraic topology, namely applications of persistent homology and the design of algorithms for topological data analysis. See also my [personal statement](/personal-statement).

## Summer Tutoring

I am for hire to tutor secondary students in Olympia, Lacey, and Tumwater
through August. I can [meet in person](https://meetme.so/coltongrainger) or [reply
to an email](mailto:colton.grainger@colorado.edu) if you are interested.
