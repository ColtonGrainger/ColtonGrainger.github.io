# Colton Grainger

This is my personal website. It's an [open
notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) and a collection
of links to other sites. For a blogroll, see [people](/see-also#people).

## February 2018 Summary

I am a [community organizer](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work) for a
family shelter in Olympia, WA. My current projects include
- facilitating [farm day care](fscss-volunteers/farm-day-care),
- developing volunteer [training curriculum](fscss-volunteers/wiki), and
- and improving our [internship program](fscss-volunteers/practicum).

My service term ends 2018-08-17, at which point I aim to start working towards a
PhD in Mathematics. (See my [personal statement](/personal-statement) for
grad-apps). I've been studying [numerical methods](/math-428) independently.
