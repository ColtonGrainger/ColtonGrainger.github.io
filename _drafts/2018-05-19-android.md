Files I want on my phone:

- music (regularly updated)
- foreign language news/podcasts
- some rss feed

## mounting and unmounting

[Don't use sudo](https://wiki.debian.org/mtp).

- `mkdir ~/android_mount` (if needed)
- connect by USB
- `jmtpfs ~/android_mount`
- file operations
- `fusermount -u ~/android_mount`
