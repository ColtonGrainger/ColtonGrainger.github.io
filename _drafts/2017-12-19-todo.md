- a static page builder that's not jekyll?
	- hakyll
- categories for organization
- tags
	- ma
- anchor js links
## Comments?

- *Colton, it's not a blog*.
- If I get comments, what's my timeline? I dunno, prolly before starting in school/work.
- I think [Jeff Kaufman's setup](https://www.jefftk.com/p/external-comment-integration-rewrite) for comments is neat. Could implement if I buy server space.
	- would also need to get back on fb (don't want)
	- *some concern for privacy*? See [Comments are now first names](https://www.jefftk.com/p/comments-are-now-first-names)
	- could also just use google groups
	- I *do* want informal feedbac (at the risk of quotidianity)k
	- here's Jeff's [webscripts repo](https://github.com/jeffkaufman/webscripts/blob/master/README) 
- [Disqus?](https://disqus.com/pricing/)
	- [no support for fb comment mirroring](https://disqus.com/home/channel/discussdisqus/discussion/channel-discussdisqus/mirroring_facebook_comments_on_website_with_disqus/)
	- also not interested in the publicity. it's not a blog. it's a record (sort of). 
	
## Community?

figure out how to credit people I'm pulling info from?

- write a new post on their topic?
	- rather on their content, then cite them
- create some sort of "people" log?
	- done this with the "see also" page. I want to keep it up to snuff, but not overwhelming.
- join a online community (like LW, stack exchange, etc and just accept that I'm following them?)
	- besides twitter, stack exchange, and wikipedia, I don't really want to make the time investment. There's an abundance of older literature that's more accessible to me if I keep away from the bleeding edge of web development.

## Voice & Tone

And how about this writing style, eh? I certainly prefer to be terse (else I'm coming off formal). I also default to formal writing when I'm nervous. So I think the boiled down, as few words as possible conversation (with loads of quotes, me spending my time reading, pursuing applications, engaged in converations, developing plot &/ character, intuiting space, etc) is fine.
