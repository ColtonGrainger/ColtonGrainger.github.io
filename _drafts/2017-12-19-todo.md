## Pages to create

- pedagogy, cite Paula Allman
- course reviews for MATH 310, MATH 451
- Olympia geography?

## Tools to use

- citewebgen
- a static page builder that's not jekyll?
	- hakyll
- categories for organization

## Comments?

- *Colton, it's not a blog*.
- If I get comments, what's my timeline? I dunno, prolly before starting in school/work.
- I think [Jeff Kaufman's setup](https://www.jefftk.com/p/external-comment-integration-rewrite) for comments is neat. Could implement if I buy server space.
	- would also need to get back on fb (don't want)
	- *some concern for privacy*? See [Comments are now first names](https://www.jefftk.com/p/comments-are-now-first-names)
	- could also just use google groups
	- I *do* want informal feedbac (at the risk of quotidianity)k
	- here's Jeff's [webscripts repo](https://github.com/jeffkaufman/webscripts/blob/master/README) 
- [Disqus?](https://disqus.com/pricing/)
	- [no support for fb comment mirroring](https://disqus.com/home/channel/discussdisqus/discussion/channel-discussdisqus/mirroring_facebook_comments_on_website_with_disqus/)
	- also not interested in the publicity. it's not a blog. it's a record (sort of). 
	
## Community?

figure out how to credit people I'm pulling info from?

- write a new post on their topic?
- create some sort of "people" log?
- join a online community (like LW, stack exchange, etc and just accept that I'm following them?)

## Voice & Tone

And how about this writing style, eh? I certainly prefer to be terse (else I'm coming off formal). I also default to formal writing when I'm nervous. So I think the boiled down, as few words as possible conversation (with loads of quotes, me spending my time reading, pursuing applications, engaged in converations, developing plot &/ character, intuiting space, etc) is fine.

## Misc

From David Hestenes and Garret Sobczyk [Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9027725616)
> Klein's seminal analysis of the structure and history of mathematics brings to light two major processes by which mathematics grows and becomes organized... The one emphasizes algebraic structure while the other emphasizes geometric interpretation. Klein's analysis shows one process alternately dominating the other in the historical development of mathematics. But there is no necessary reason that the two processes should operate in mutual exclusion. Indeed, each process is undoubtedly grounded in one the two great capacities of the human mind: the capacity for language and the capacity for spatial perception. From the psychological point of view, then, the fusion of algebra with geometry is so fundamental that one could well say, 'Geometry without algebra is dumb! Algebra without geometry is blind!'
