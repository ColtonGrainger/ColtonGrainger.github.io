## Conversation with Miriam

Miriam and I videochatted. I was getting ready to go paint the shelter & eating breakfast. Tired from sketching solutions for my ODEs class and anxious knowing I didn't have time to write them up properly. (In fact, I could only typeset half by the deadline.) To quote [Mark Tarver](http://www.marktarver.com/bipolar.html)
> Why is this?  Well, its partly to do with vision.   The 'vision thing' as George Bush Snr. once described it, is really one of the strengths of the BBM.  He can see far; further than in fact his strength allows him to travel.  He conceives of brilliant ambitious projects requiring great resources, and he embarks on them only to run out of steam.  It's not that he's lazy; its just that his resources are insufficient.

Mariam felt she's been suffering from Analysis Paralysis. She said she wants to contribute to a some sort of public dialogue, but is hesitant to finalize her thoughts in writing. As well, openness to share only apply to other areas of my life.

Taking risks to be a novice, then building energy to become a seasoned beginner. Not a strong finisher.
