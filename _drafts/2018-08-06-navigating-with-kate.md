I survey the Math department, the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and link to just-in-time review materials (all before prior to getting locked into the maths pillar sequences this fall)

## Maths pillar sequences


Disclaimer: this advice is relevant to the 2018-19 academic year, and, etc, the reader should check with the department for more authoritative advice. Thanks.

From the department chair, [Kate Stange](http://math.colorado.edu/~kstange/):

> Your main task in your first couple years is the required courses and
> prelim exams.  There are three main fall/spring sequences offered each year:
> 
> - algebra 1 & 2
> - analysis 1 & 2
> - topology & geometry
> 
> and one additional requirement: complex analysis
> 
> Each sequence has an associated prelim exam, but you needn't worry about
> those until you've completed the sequence in most cases.
> 
> Your usual course load would be 15 credits, which is 5 courses over the
> year.  You can do (3 fall / 2 spring) or (2 fall / 3 spring).  I usually
> recommend taking 2/3, since in fall you'll still be getting your sea legs.
> (You can also take 3/3 with your tuition credit -- beyond that I think you
> have to start paying more.)
> 
> The normal thing to do would be to take two pillar sequences.  These
> courses are heavy loads (think of one pillar course as two regular courses
> in terms of workload hours).  Electives will generally be lighter loads,
> and in spring you might choose an elective.  However, you might want a fall
> elective if something particular interests you (3/2).
>
> I would go with whatever is most comfortable/familiar to begin.  If you are
> an algebra type, start with the algebra, etc.  You can also register for
> all 3 and then perhaps drop one after a week or two.  You can also attend
> one you aren't registered for for a while, just to see (just mention it to
> the instructor).
> 
> So, in short, my recommendation is to pick two of the three courses listed
> above, and you will also take Math 5905, our one-credit teaching course.
> 
> As far as electives go, just a note:  cross-listed 5000/4000 level courses
> are sometimes aimed at undergraduates and graduate students from other
> departments.  Please ask the instructor if it's appropriate for Math PhD
> students.

## Collaboration with applied maths, CS, and physics

Two ways of getting involved: attend talks (easy) and take courses (have to petition).

### Non-academic mentoring

    - NCAR
    - NIST
    - NOAA (tours on Tuesday)

The maths faculty may be work as "consultants" over the summer (e.g., for cryptography), but during the academic year it's pure nose-to-book grinding (and [tracking rides on strava](https://www.wired.com/story/strava-heat-map-military-bases-fitness-trackers-privacy/)).

### Summer employment options in maths dept

- teach (8 weeks)
- REU (8 weeks)
- outside activity (internship)
    - see [NIST-PREP](https://www.colorado.edu/physics/nist-prep)

### Diagnostic exams in algebra and analysis

(From 2018-04-18)

Having a comparatively weak undergraduate background, I recognize I need to
build as much mathematical momentum as possible leading up to my qualifying
exams at CU Boulder. As a first step I, here, highlight portions of the
department's expectations for incoming PhD students, and list resources to prep
for an initial diagnostic exam in algebra and analysis.

[“Rules and Requirements, Department of Mathematics, University of Colorado Boulder”](https://www.colorado.edu/math/graduate-program/rules-and-requirements#1.-Courses-(Ph.D.-students)). Retrieved April 19, 2018. 

> The diagnostic exam is offered in the summer before a student starts and
> consists of two parts: algebra and analysis, both of which are based on the
> material in a typical first-semester undergraduate course. The goal is to
> establish how prepared students from widely varying backgrounds are for
> particular graduate courses.
> 
> On the basis of the exam results, the Graduate Committee will recommend that
> the student either register for the graduate courses or that the student take
> a lower-level course to make up for deficiencies. Typical recommendations are
> Math 5140 or Math 5150 (for algebra) and Math 5001 or APPM 5440 (for
> analysis). Although the exam is mandatory, the recommendations are only
> advisory, and the student may choose not to follow them.

> All students must pass Algebra 1 (Math 6130), Algebra 3 (Math 6140), Analysis
> 1 (Math 6310), Analysis 2 (Math 6320), Topology 2 (Math 6210), Differential
> Geometry 1 (Math 6230), and Complex Analysis 2 (Math 6350) with a grade of B-
> or better in each. The only exceptions are for students who unconditionally
> pass the corresponding preliminary exam (Algebra, Analysis, or
> Topology/Geometry); students who pass conditionally must complete the full
> pillar sequence. Students who have taken similar courses elsewhere may
> petition the Graduate Committee to obtain an exemption. 

> The three "pillar sequences" are Algebra 1 and 2, Analysis 1 and 2, and
> Topology 1/Geometry 1. At least one pillar sequence must be completed by the
> end of the first year. We recommend completing at least two by the end of the
> first year. All three pillar sequences must be completed by the end of the
> second year. Complex Analysis (Math 6350) must be passed by the end of the
> semester in which the student passes the Comprehensive Exam, which must happen
> by the end of the seventh semester.

### meta

I'm inspired foremost by Michael Pacer, who I understand to have taken up the
challenge of "producing something of potential worth for others" with gusto in
his own preparations for qualifying exams in cognitive science.

[“Explaining this collection”](https://mpacer.org/explaining-this-collection/).
Michael Pacer.

> Knowing myself, I knew that I would be more motivated by the idea of
> producing something that is of potential worth for others than I would be by
> the mere prospect of perfunctorily checking a bureaucrats' box. However
> important it may be, filling forms, checking those boxes has never been a
> particularly appealing prospect.My secret assumption has always been that
> everyone agrees with me (even the stuffy bureaucrats), but that others are
> better able to see past the grid into which they are placing themselves to
> the real purpose of whatever exercise is being conducted. I make the
> assumption of my own myopathy before I assume that the world truly revels in
> forcing people to do things that have a tenuous relation to what matters in
> the long run. ”

Pacer scanned 19 field notebooks of responses to each article on an ambitious
reading list.

![](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5415d6d6e4b09de883251c2f/541faed5e4b0ff88564851a0/541fb487e4b09194f7694010/1411363991191/Splitting+the+cost+of+thought+47.png?format=750w){:width="100%"}

![](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5415d6d6e4b09de883251c2f/542105a7e4b042b085c88779/542124ece4b0462bd0f5b7b3/1411458298501/Cracken+the+Hull+03.png?format=750w){:width="100%"}

Tangible.

I imagine purchasing a large scanner (50-page capacity) to drop my sheets of
notes into at the end of each day. I think scanning in notes would be a bit
more chronological than organizing the notebooks from memory by hand. 

If I'm going to ape Pacer, I want to be explicit that I want the records to
*look good* after the fact. I think keeping a flat hierarchy of between
different low-barrier media would be sufficient as a "product" of value to
others. 

Media to use:

- jupyter notebooks for computational examples
- podcasts? interviews? (transcribed)
- text files in pandoc markdown
- dated scans of handwritten notes
  - letter paper, folded long into 2 columns

I'm missing a $\TeX$ formatting template, especially for bibliographies.

One remedy would be to import administrative skill from [Matt
Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/books-papers-materials-for-graduate-students/).


## Plans to apply for NSF graduate fellowship

- attend STEMinar

- pitch TDA proposals

    - presenting own ideas
    - asking for open problems

- application tips

    - to explain the problem/impact
    - lie out tools to be used in the approach

- what kind of research? 

> I just wanted to add a little info about the NSF GRF opportunity.  I
> encourage students to consider applying (I suggest speaking to your faculty
> mentor about this).  It is a great honour to receive one and would be
> valuable in terms of extra research time and flexibility (it would replace
> teaching as a funding source, and allow travel).
> 
> Students who apply must be citizens or permanent residents.  Generally,
> students can apply only once after they begin their PhD work, either the
> fall of their first or second year.  The deadline is in mid October, and
> you need to have 3 letter writers and transcripts organized well before
> this.

> Note:  This program is multi-disciplinary, and the design fits well in lab
