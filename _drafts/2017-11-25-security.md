As I move more information online, what information do I need to encrypt? to back-up? 

## Security Goals

- hosting my website on linode and adding a public key certificate
- understanding and implementing PGP for emails
- symmetric encryption for personal documents

## Data Management 

- backing up national origin documents, medical records, etc. to optical disk
- differentiating between private and public documents
	- cloud storage?
- organized file system
	- d'Alembert's taxonomy of knowledge in the Encyclopedie. 
	- broad categories: projects, life, private 
	- standarized UNIX directory tree?
