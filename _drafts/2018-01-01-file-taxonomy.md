title: Directory Trees and File Taxonomy

I aim to use a directory tree that is legible, recoverable, and easily secured.

## questions for now

- What's the standard UNIX directory tree? 
- Which files should be public? private? somewhere between indiscrete and
  discrete?
    - e.g., collaborative documents to be shared with only a working group?
    - see Matt Might's [CRAPL](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl) (an
      academic strength open source license).
- To use cloud storage?
    - Evernote? (might encourage hoarding)
    - "a hand rolled wiki"? (preferred, something to learn anyways, and I can
      always switch to evernote after having the experience of doing it
      myself.)
- What about pairing a directory tree with an established taxonomy?
    - e.g., d'Alembert's taxonomy of knowledge in the Encyclopedie
    - the Math Subject Classification
    - broad categories: projects, life, private 

## chronological vs taxonomic organization

I think CV style personal organization is fine. In order to get on with life,
it seems natural to associate old projects with specific age ranges (high
school, undergrad, etc).

At the same time, anything I intend to be public should be located and labelled
in a taxonomy of knowledge. I made a pretty decent TODO taxonomy this summer
(to regulate the level one headers of my `todo.org`), but my question how to
group semiotic outputs and other utterances is still open. 

- health
- finance
- career
- research
- ...classes...
- teaching
- service
- chores
- config
- unsorted

I might initially establish whether the output is public
or private. I could then concentrate organization efforts on the public side
(since I have little reason to pretty up private information for other folks).
Update: I helped myself discern more between public and private by taking an
exhaustive personal inventory.

I think useful private categories (private simply because these matters are *so
noisey*, being right against the quotidian grind of physical existence) include
health, finance, and residency.
