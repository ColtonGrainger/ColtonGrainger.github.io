This is the repository for my personal webpage.

I relied extensively on 
- [maban's instructions](https://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/), 
- [Thinkful's flow chart](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/), and 
- [Jonathan McGlone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
to create the page.
