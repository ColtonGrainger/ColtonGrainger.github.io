Galois Theory for Differential Equations, *May 2016* [(pdf)](documents/cgrainger_coursework_galois.pdf) [(poster)](documents/cgrainger_coursework_galois_poster.pdf)
- Following Michio Kuga's analysis of Fuchsian-type differential equations, I parameterize the solution space of the hypergeometric equation. For interesting 
cases, I find the monodromy representation at singular points.
