**2016: Galois Theory for Differential Equations** [(pdf)](documents/cgrainger_coursework_galois.pdf) [(poster)](documents/cgrainger_coursework_galois_poster.pdf)<br>
Following Michio Kuga's analysis of Fuchsian-type differential equations, I parameterize the solution space of the hypergeometric equation. For interesting cases, I find the monodromy representation at singular points. Presented at the College of Idaho's Student Research Conference.
