Thanks to the following people for technical guidance.

+ [Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/)
+ [Issa Rice](http://issarice.com)

*Much* credit to Issa Rice for forging ahead in creating a really crisp style sheet. I've pulled multiple features from his site (e.g., headers, CC0 licensing, and general modus operandi). 

These folks have encouraged me (i) to create on online presence, (ii) to disregard categories imposed by gender, and (iii) to especially have hope for the future.
