## Texts

Two python language CS books. Both of them have pages available online. 
- [Scientific Computation: Python Hacking for Math Junkies 3.0](http://calculuscastle.com/pythonbook.html)  (by Bruce E. Shapiro)
- [Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications](http://codingthematrix.com/) 
  (by Philip N. Klein) 

A reference for sheer pleasure (the 1994 user manual from Leslie Lamport).
- [LaTeX, A Document Preparation System (2nd edition)](https://www.amazon.com/LaTeX-Document-Preparation-System-2nd/dp/0201529831)

Notes on scientific writing, from Donald Knuth's 1980 course.
- [CS 209, Mathematical Writing](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)

Another reference. It's got an introduction, then some methods, and ends with a glossary of methods. The author recommends that a reader digests the glossary slowly, while problem solving.
- [How to Solve it: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method](https://notendur.hi.is/hei2/teaching/Polya_HowToSolveIt.pdf) (by G. Polya)
